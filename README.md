Flappy Bird Game in Python using Pygame

This project is an implementation of the classic Flappy Bird game using the Pygame library in Python. The game features a bird that the player controls, guiding it through a series of pipes by tapping the space bar or pressing the up arrow key. The objective is to navigate through the pipes without colliding with them or the ground. The game keeps track of the player's score based on the number of pipes successfully passed.

Key Features:

Responsive bird control with space bar or up arrow key. Randomly generated pipes to provide dynamic gameplay. Score tracking and display. Game over screen with the final score upon collision. Background music and sound effects for an immersive experience.

How to Play:

Press space or the up arrow key to start the game. Control the bird's altitude by tapping the space bar or pressing the up arrow key. Navigate through the pipes to earn points. Avoid collisions with pipes and the ground. The game ends when the bird collides, and the final score is displayed.

Dependencies:

Python 3.x Pygame library

Instructions to Run:

Install Python on your system. Install the Pygame library using pip install pygame. Run the script, and the game will start. Acknowledgments: This project is created as a fun and educational endeavor, inspired by the classic Flappy Bird game. The Pygame library provides a convenient platform for developing 2D games in Python.
